st.markdown("The following conversation showcases two interesting features of Health-E. First, it recognizes that no cause has been provided and responds accordingly with a general suggestion. Second, Health-e has a one message memory; which allows the user to correct itself if needed.")
st.markdown("Additionally, it highlights a few current limitations. For instance, logic suggests that the urgency of a coffee burn should be much lower compared to a torch burn. In the short term, this can be overcome via prompt engineering and further fine-tuning. Moreover, the one message memory limits the length of a conversation significantly. In part, this was done by design to encourage fast processing. Assuming that the bot will be used primarily to process appointments and not as a counselor, which would require longer memory, this is a reasonable trade-off.")
